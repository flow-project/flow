    "When running AWS experiments, your entire `rllab` directory is uploaded to AWS so that the files necessary for your experiment are available to the EC2 instance. Thus, commands are included to copy over your `flow` directory to your `rllab` root directory (this is the reason for the `RLLABDIR` variable above). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Before running an experiment, run `make prepare` from your `flow` directory.\n",
    "- Ensure you have committed or otherwise tracked the state of your `flow` directory, because that instance is what will be used to run your experiment. Upon visualization, the same files will need to be used—for example, changes to environment's state-space would break the ability to run a trained policy using a different state space. Check out an old commit of your `flow` directory and run `make prepare` to use visualization tools included with rllab.\n",
    "\n",
    "`make clean` removes the debug directory and also all XML files in rllab root directory to reduce the size of the data to upload to AWS. If you are using already-existing network files (from, say, OpenStreetMap), ensure they do not get deleted by `make clean` by storing such files elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the experiment, change the `mode` to `ec2` (other options are `local` and `local_docker`). You should run the experiment in `local_docker` mode briefly before running the `ec2` version to ensure there are no errors, particularly with Docker image compatability\n",
    "\n",
    "After running `python example.py` once the `mode` of `example.py` is `ec2`, you should see your experiment running on AWS."
