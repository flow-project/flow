    "# Tutorial 09: Inflows\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks you through the process of introducing inflows of vehicles into a network. Inflows allow us to simulate open networks where vehicles may enter (and potentially exit) the network. This exercise is organized as follows: in section 1 we prepare our inflows variables to support inflows into a merge network supplied by Flow, and in section 2 we simulate the merge network in the presence of inflows.\n",

    "## 1. Adding Inflows\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will simulate inflows through a highway network with an on-merge. As we will see, the perturbations caused by vehicles entering through the on-merge leads the formation of congested waves downstream in the main highway.\n",
