    "## 2. Defining Traffic Light Phases \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off, we define how Sumo represents traffic light phases. A phase is defined as the states that the traffic lights around an intersection can take. The typical four-way, traffic-light-controlled intersection is modeled by a string of length 12. Consider the phase \"GGGrrrGGGrrr\". Every 3 letters in this phase string (\"GGG\", \"rrr\", \"GGG\", \"rrr\") corresponds to an edge in the intersection, in clockwise order. Explicitly, the northern and southern edges of the intersection both have a state of \"GGG\", where the eastern and western edges of the intersection both have a state of \"rrr\". For each of the three letters in each substring, the first corresponds to a left hand turn, the second corresponds to a straight, and the third corresponds to a right hand turn. For example, a substring \"GrG\" indicates a traffic light with a green left hand turn, a red straight, and a green right hand turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sumo traffic lights are initiated to a default set of phases, and will not deviate from the phases provided in their configuration files. We will describe in this section how to define custom phases for traffic lights.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: If the API is used at any point to modify the traffic light state, i.e. functions such as `setRedYellowGreenState`, this will override the traffic light's default phase.\n",

For the experiment we are using with 2 rows and 3 columns, there are 6 nodes: \"center0\" to \"center5\".\n",
