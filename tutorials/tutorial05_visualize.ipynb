    "The visualization of simulation results breaks down into three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **reward plotting**: Visualization of the reward function is an essential step in evaluating the effectiveness and training progress of RL agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **policy replay**: Flow includes tools for visualizing trained policies using SUMO's GUI. This enables more granular analysis of policies beyond their accrued reward, which in turn allows users to tweak actions, observations and rewards in order to produce some desired behavior. The visualizers also generate plots of observations and a plot of the reward function over the course of the rollout.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **data collection and analysis**: Any Flow experiment can output its simulation data to a CSV file, `emission.csv`, containing the contents of SUMO's built-in `emission.xml` files. This file contains various data such as the speed, position, time, fuel consumption and many other metrics for every vehicle in the network and at each time step of the simulation. Once you have generated the `emission.csv` file, you can open it and read the data it contains using Python's [csv library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) (or using Excel)."
