Networks define the network geometry of a task, as well as the constituents of the network, e.g. vehicles, traffic lights, etc... Various networks are available in Flow, depicting a diverse set of open and closed traffic networks such as ring roads, intersections, traffic light grids, straight highway merges, and more. \n",
