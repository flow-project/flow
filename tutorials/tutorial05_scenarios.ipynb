    "This tutorial walks you through the process of generating custom scenarios. Scenarios define the network geometry of a task, as well as the constituents of the network, e.g. vehicles, traffic lights, etc... Various scenarios are available in Flow, depicting a diverse set of open and closed traffic networks such as ring roads, intersections/grids, straight highway merges, and more. \n",

It also specifies the location of edge nodes in the network, as well as the positioning of vehicles at the start of a run.\n",

Once the base scenario has been inherited, specifying these features becomes very systematic. All child classes are required to define at least the following three methods: \n",
