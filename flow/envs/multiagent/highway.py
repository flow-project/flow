    """Partially observable multi-agent environment for an highway with ramps.

    This environment is used to train autonomous vehicles to attenuate the
    formation and propagation of waves in an open highway network.

    The highway can contain an arbitrary number of entrance and exit ramps, and
    is intended to be used with the HighwayRampsNetwork network.

    The policy is shared among the agents, so there can be a non-constant
    number of RL vehicles throughout the simulation.

    Required from env_params:

    * max_accel: maximum acceleration for autonomous vehicles, in m/s^2
    * max_decel: maximum deceleration for autonomous vehicles, in m/s^2
    * target_velocity: desired velocity for all vehicles in the network, in m/s

    The following states, actions and rewards are considered for one autonomous
    vehicle only, as they will be computed in the same way for each of them.

    States
        The observation consists of the speeds and bumper-to-bumper headways of
        the vehicles immediately preceding and following autonomous vehicle, as
        well as the speed of the autonomous vehicle.

    Actions
        The action consists of an acceleration, bound according to the
        environment parameters, as well as three values that will be converted
        into probabilities via softmax to decide of a lane change (left, none
        or right).

    Rewards
        The reward function encourages proximity of the system-level velocity
        to a desired velocity specified in the environment parameters, while
        slightly penalizing small time headways among autonomous vehicles.

    Termination
        A rollout is terminated if the time horizon is reached or if two
        vehicles collide into one another.
